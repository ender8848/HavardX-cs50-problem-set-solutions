Hello World!

This is my solution to the HarvardX cs50's problem sets. 

HarvardX cs50 is an introduction to Scratch, C, Python and other basic foundamentals in CS. The official website is listed as follow.

https://cs50.harvard.edu/


As a major-changer from Chemistry to CS, I am going to familiar myself with C and other programming laguages and terminologies in CS, and most importantly I will share my solutions to cs50 problem sets. 

Welcome and feel free to share any questions, concerns and comments for my code! 


PS: IDE for cs50 is here - https://ide.cs50.io/

Testing for the C code must be done in this IDE.
